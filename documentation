FPGA design process
I/O interface core - structural RTL timing constraints
standard cores
accelerator cores - constructe for a specific application by a system designer. custom cores designed using HLS.

Integrating design - two design methodologies
1. HLS generated accelerator core is like any other core, they are combined with I/O interface cores and standard cores to form a design.
this is called core based design methodology

Platform based design methologies- integrate different algorithms (roles) within interfaces provided by a singple platform or shell. Standard design templates called platforms are available.

Design optimization
performance characterization
1. computation time
2. seconds (to account for different clock domains)
3. Task -atomic unit of behavior, task latency - time between tast start and finish. Task interval - time between one task start and next starts
4. data rate - depends on task interval and size of araguments to function

Area throughput tradeoffs

HLS optimizations
1. loop unrolling
2. loop pipelining
3. bitwidth optimization
4. function inlining
5. hierarchy
6. array optimizations
7. task pipelining
8. test bench
9. co simulation
10. streaming
11. interfacing
